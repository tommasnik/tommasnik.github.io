The generating of sprites works like this:
- you configure how the character should look like and what it should wear
- the configuration is a set of filters, e.g. "body=Body_color_amber&head=Human_male_amber&beards=Beard_rose&cape=Solid_rose&beard=Basic_Beard_ash&sex=female&shield=Crusader_shield_crusader&sash=Obi_blue"
- each filter is created like this:

There's a category (see the _index.json file for all categories). Each category has values - it's the values in _index.json file. It also has it's own configuration file (see belt.json for example). There are category values (e.g. "Belly_belt" ) and colors for such value (e.g. "brown") in the configuration files. From these you will create the filter like this:
<category>=<value>_<color>
e.g. belt=Belly_belt_brown

Then you create a url filter (see the previous example) for all selected filters.

The first step is to go through the _index.json to get a good set of categories and values and then you will just add the colors according to the appropriate files.

When you have filters, generate url:
