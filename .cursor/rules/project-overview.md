# Project Overview: Skill-Based Mobile RPG with Precision Combat

This project is a 2D, mobile-first role-playing game featuring top-down world exploration and 1:1 real-time combat focused on precision aiming.

Players navigate a map, encountering enemies that trigger a dedicated battle screen. Combat is visually structured with the player at the bottom and the enemy at the top.

Players select from a set of skills, each with unique mechanics and cooldowns, and must time their attacks to hit specific enemy zones for varying effects.

The game emphasizes skill-based progression, with both characters and individual skills leveling up, and features a range of RPG attributes and animated 2D visuals optimized for mobile and PC controls.
